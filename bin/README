datagen
-------
Generate Avro records for 5 discrete schemas. Each successive schema is compatible with its antecedent.

conv
----
Convert the generated Avro records to an Avro-backed Parquet data file. No schema evolution is performed.

evo
---
Attempt to migrate/evolve Avro and Avro-backed Parquet data files to new data files with a compatible and updated Avro schema.

clean
-----
Remove generated data files.

Notes
=====

Schema evolution is currently only performed against two schemas at once. For example, if schema 1 is succeeded by schema 2, our evolution job
will select the data files created with schema 1 and attempt to evolve them to schema 2.

Theoretically, schema 5 should be backwards compatible with schemas 1 through 4, and a single job should be able to migrate data files generated with schemas 1 through 4 to schema 5.

Our production workflows are not necessarily concerned with updating schemas as an end goal, rather, it is a necessary part of the process of being able to have a single job run against a large, constantly evolving data set described by a single schema. You can imagine running a job over a months' worth of data where the schema used to defined that dataset has changed (in compatible ways) during that month.
